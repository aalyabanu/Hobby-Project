# STEM Sheffield

## Project Brief
Stem Sheffield is a hobby project, aiming to provide a simple and colourful way to find about Stem Events taking place in Sheffield and beyond. Future extension of this prject could be to enabling users to add events to their calendar and also set reminders for events. 


## Summary of Tech Stack
The webpage has been designed purely in using HTML and CSS. In addition to providing a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals, this project has also been helped me understand some new features such as bootstrap cards.
